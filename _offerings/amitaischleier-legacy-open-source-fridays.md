_(Don't know C? Neither did I, until I met this code. You know languages inspired by C. I'm quite sure you'll be able to understand, contribute, learn, and enjoy, or your money back. Please keep reading.)_

When you work with legacy code, your every move fraught with extra risk, it can be difficult to make room to experiment and learn.
When you live in a codebase, over time it can even become difficult to perceive opportunities for experiments and learning.

This is especially unfortunate, because it's precisely legacy code -- valuable code that we're afraid to change -- that places the most strenuous demands on your **perceptual acuity**, your **creativity**, and your ruthlessly disciplined **outcome-focused learning**.

It's time to take your head for a stroll.

Play with _someone else's_ legacy code, accompanied by an experienced guide.
Encounter some familiar puzzles and some novel ones.
See things you might not otherwise see.
Try things you might not otherwise try.
Meet some unusual compatibility constraints you might never otherwise meet.
Practice the legacy-code improvement loop: narrow the decision space, weigh the remaining options, and take the next sensible step.
Ship meaningful improvements to software that's publicly available and widely valued.
Feel pride in your contribution and in our progress from week to week.
Sharpen your vision, refresh your cleverness, stretch, reenergize.
Then return to your own code with new insights and confidence to find new ways forward.

Upon the conclusion of our very first Legacy Open Source Friday, three participants immediately registered for every available session in the booking system.
One of them told me:

> "You have a good vision and confidence in the project.
> That energy is contagious.
> Everyone felt the excitement."

See for yourself what the excitement is all about.
One of these Fridays, join us.
