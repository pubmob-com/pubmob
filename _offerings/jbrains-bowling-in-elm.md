I'm doing a volunteer project for the [Western Canadian Bowling Tour](https://wcbtour.ca) in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), building a system to help gather statistical information both from automated scoring systems and from a specialized data-entry system. Let's go _beyond_ the bowling kata, deal with some of the realities of Serverless, and do it for 5-pin bowling, because it's much, much better than 10-pin.
