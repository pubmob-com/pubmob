I love TDD. Not everyone does. Sometimes we just want to practise guiding a design to evolve without spending time to write tests. I don't _recommend_ this as a way to work, but I understand why you might prefer it, **especially if you've been practising TDD for a while and worry that it still just... feels... so... slow**. Sometimes it helps to spend time focusing on guiding a design to evolve using tiny steps, frequent commits, and a trusted guide. (That's me!)

We'll work in Java, because compile-time type checking helps make this safer. We'll work on my teaching example, because I know it well and consequently we'll be able to get moving sooner. But you'll drive---and when you go down a dusty road, I'll be there to help you get back on track. Just keep this in mind: without tests, we'll need to take _teeny, tiny steps_ just to be safe. Don't worry: I trust you.
