Say what you want about Java: it's not going away any time soon. Let's try refactoring some Java code, strengthening and deepening our skill in Evolutionary Design. We'll introduce some functional programming design style using Vavr, we'll experience using tests to influence our design decisions, and we'll just _experiment_. We'll speculate like mad. We'll throw off the chains of "nobody will let us" and "the architects won't like it". With any luck, you can take some of this experience and find warm, dry places to practise like this at your day job.

We're refactoring an Android application. I don't know much about Android, so you don't need to worry if you don't. My primary goal is to apply the lessons of the Universal Architecture model to rescue as much code as we can from Android and make the _happy zone_ as big and wonderful as we can make it.
