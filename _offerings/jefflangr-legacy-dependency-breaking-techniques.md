Let's start getting some of your legacy code under control!

In this session, I'll help you and your team jump-start getting your legacy code under control. Our primary focus will be on writing enough characterization tests around your code so that you feel safe changing it.

As we work through the session, you'll pick up some key themes for safe handling of legacy code. You'll probably learn about at least one of the following dependency breaking techniques:

* Expose static method
* Extract and override call
* Parameterize constructor
* Break out method object
* Template redefinition (C++)
