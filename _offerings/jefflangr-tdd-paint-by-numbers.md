TDD Paint by Number sessions are gentle introductions to TDD. You and your co-mobbers will take turns getting tests to pass. This will allow you to quickly ingrain the red-green-refactor rhythm of TDD without having to know how to code the tests, or even what tests to code next. This gentler approach will allow you to focus on the meaty payoff of TDD--being able to incrementally add new behaviors and keep the codebase clean through refactoring.

Since we'll be all working on the same codebase, scheduled sessions show
the programming language and compiler version you'll need. You'll also see which
exercise you'll get to participate in.

Your {{ site.session-lead-term }} will provide you with specific build instructions to ensure you're ready to 
hit the ground running.
