TDD Paint by Numbers is a great way to learn test-driven development without the test part. The tests are already written for you, so you'll get to experience TDD without writing the tests. You and the others in this session will take turns getting tests to pass, then cleaning up the code.

So you'll learn: The red-green-refactor cycle of TDD / How to focus on getting from red to green / Disciplined refactoring: moving in small, verified steps

We'll be working on the same codebase, using Swift on Xcode 12.

Your {{ site.session-lead-term }} will provide you with specific build instructions to ensure you're ready to 
hit the ground running.
