Whether you're new to testing or a seasoned professional, mob testing is a great way to improve you skills and learn new techniques you can use on your own testing projects.

Testing dojos have become a popular way for testers to come together and work on testing challenges together.  I'll moderate mobbing sessions focused on specific applications or technologies that will hone your skills across different types of testing as well as specific app technologies.

We'll keep the challenges fresh to ensure a wide array of learning experiences!
