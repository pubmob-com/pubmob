summary-blurb-80-words: "<p>Sometimes when developing software we're tasked with redesigning the entire infrastructure. These changes can be a huge overhaul to our applications and introduce a lot of risk. With the flexibility of modern VCS, such as Git and Mercurial, it's tempting to create a branch while developing these changes to reduce the risk of jeopardizing other releases.</p><p>By creating a branch to house these large changes you begin to venture away from continuous integration. What if you could still continuously integrate your code when working on such refactors?</p><p>In this session, we'll take a “monolith” and extract functionality into a smaller micro-service while maintaining frequent and small commits.</p>"
